    <h1>Advertising Guidelines</h1>

    <p>
      Enlightenment is committed to unbiased, independent journalism. Accepting
      funds for advertising or sponsored content allows Enlightenment to expand
      our coverage of global news and events consistent with the Trust
      Principles. The following guidelines explain how Enlightenment protects
      our journalistic integrity and the trust of our readers and customers
      while working with advertisers and sponsors.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>
        The following guidelines apply to all advertisements published on any
        Enlightenment platform, including advertisements created by our
        advertisers or in collaboration with Enlightenment Solutions. An
        advertisement is content controlled and paid for by a third
        party.</strong
      >
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        No relationship with an advertiser or advertising deal will compromise
        Enlightenment’ strict compliance with the Trust Principles, which
        require independence, integrity and freedom from bias.
      </li>

      <li>
        Enlightenment’ editorial staff will not create, edit, influence or
        otherwise contribute to the production of advertising.
      </li>

      <li>
        Advertisements will be clearly distinguishable from content created by
        Enlightenment’ editorial staff. If necessary to make the distinction, an
        advertisement will be prominently marked as "Advertisement."
      </li>

      <li>
        Advertisers are responsible for the content of their advertisements.
        Their advertising must comply with all applicable laws, regulations and
        guidelines and must not be false or misleading.
      </li>

      <li>
        Advertisements do not reflect the views of Enlightenment or its
        editorial staff. Even so, Enlightenment reserves the right to reject or
        remove any advertisement if in Enlightenment’ opinion the advertisement
        is inaccurate, misleading or could harm Enlightenment’ reputation.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>
        The following guidelines apply to content independently created by
        Enlightenment’ news department, but funded in whole or in part by a
        paying sponsor:</strong
      >
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Accepting funding from sponsors to create editorially-independent
        content may allow Enlightenment to enrich our news file, expand our
        offerings for readers and customers, or explore previously examined news
        subjects in a new way or with a more in-depth analysis.
      </li>

      <li>
        Enlightenment may accept funding from paying sponsors if we would
        produce the content even without the funding because it is newsworthy.
      </li>

      <li>
        Enlightenment will agree to accept funding for content if the editorial
        leadership of Enlightenment News, including the Editor-in-Chief, agrees
        that the sponsorship deal is consistent with Enlightenment’ editorial
        standards and the Trust Principles.
      </li>

      <li>
        Sponsored content must be editorially independent content that is just
        as valuable, unbiased and reliable as all other Enlightenment news
        content. This means:
        <ul>
          <li>
            At the beginning of a sponsorship deal, Enlightenment and the
            sponsor may agree on broad subject areas for coverage. The sponsor
            may suggest more specific topics for Enlightenment to cover, but
            Enlightenment is not obligated to accept the sponsor’s ideas and
            will do so only if, in Enlightenment’ editorial discretion, the
            topics are newsworthy and of legitimate interest to our customers.
          </li>

          <li>
            Enlightenment journalists, or journalists acting at the direction of
            Enlightenment’ editorial staff, will collect facts and information,
            produce, and edit the content, without input or influence by the
            sponsor, to the same standards that apply to other Enlightenment
            news content. Enlightenment will not show copy to sponsors prior to
            publication.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        Sponsored content will be prominently identified as "This
        [article/page/series/section] was [funded/funded in part] by [Brand X].
        It was independently created by Enlightenment’ editorial staff. [Brand
        X] had no editorial involvement in its creation or production."
      </li>
    </ul>
